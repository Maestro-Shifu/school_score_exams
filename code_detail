Analyzing SchoolÂ´s Test Scores
ðŸ“– Background
A school makes every student take year-end math, reading, and writing exams. Includes year-end exam grades for 1,000 students. The school data, available on this link, It also has the following fields :

ðŸ’¾ The data
exam score in math, reading and writing
gender, race/ethnicity of the student
the highest education level of either parent
whether the student took the test preparation course.
The school are interested in knowing -The averages and the influence of taking or not taking the test score. -What are the average scores for the different parental education levels? -The correlation between the results in the different tests.

Female and male students are more or less equally distributed.

Only 35% of students have taken the test preparation course.

The average scores for math, reading, and writing are 66, 69, and 68 respectively.

In terms of the highest level of education achieved by either parent, there are six categories.

the higher the educational level of the parents, the higher the results of the kids..

Students whose parents did not go to college had a low overall average score of 64.1.

There's an 8.4-point average gap between the lowest scoring group, group A, and the highest scoring group, group E.

Summary
Test preparation courses are indeed helpful

Overall, test preparation courses helped students increase their overall score by an average of 7.7 points, the biggest improvement was observed in writing test scores.

Students who score well on one subject score well on other subjects

This indicates that a student's propensity to do well in school has less to do with their individual proclivity for certain subjects and more to do with outside factors.

A Higher Education level among parents had a positive influence on students' scores

A higher education among parents seems to have positively influenced their children's school grades. Students whose parents didn't go to college had the lowest scores on average.

Recommentations
When it comes to lunch status and income disparity, there is little the school can do.

On the positive side, the test preparation course does help students improve their grades, so the obvious and only solution is to make the test prep course mandatory for all students and part of the standard curriculum.

Additionally, the school could consider dedicating more resources to helping students in the minority group A who seem to be struggling more than most.
